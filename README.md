# React Three.js Test

A React + Three.js demo of a robot model viewer, using [react-three](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-three).

## Run locally (recommended)

After checking out:

* `npm install`
* `npm install -g gulp` # Install gulp if you haven't already
* `gulp serve`
* Take a look at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Hosted version (recommended only on a good network connection!)

You can try the hosted version at [react-three-demo.herokuapp.com](http://react-three-demo.herokuapp.com)
although please be warned that the second model in particular is very big (~16MB),
so make sure you're on a good wifi connection!
